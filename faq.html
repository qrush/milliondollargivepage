<h2>FAQ</h2>

<hr class="c">

<b>What is this site?</b>
<p>
  This is a shameless ripoff of <a href="http://milliondollarhomepage.com">The Million Dollar Homepage</a>. This <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage'>Wikipedia article</a> has everything you need to know and more about it.
</p>

<b>Who are you? Why did you start this?</b>
<p>
  I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/qrush">Nick Quaranto</a>, and this started as a humble attempt at fitting in with many other amazing creators on <a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>. After asking others to give/donate, <a href="http://twitter.com/jfine">Jared</a> bought a nice domain for the site.
</p>

<b>Why bother?</b>
<p>
  Because it's fun, and worth it. Also, I will earn none of the money and do all of the work, and if this has inspired even one more person to donate something to charity or volunteer their time for others, it's worth it.
</p>

<b>What charity should I donate to?</b>
<p>
  I don't know! I have a good guess though: Search for some homeless shelters or food kitchens in your town/city/area. I bet they need help.
</p>

<b>I give in small amounts throughout the year. Is that OK?</b>
<p>
  Yes! Just send in the receipt(s), take a screenshot, anything to prove that's your deal.
</p>

<b>My business donated money to a charity. Can we get some pixels for that?</b>
<p>
  Definitely. Check out the <a href="/give.html">give page</a> to see what you need to do next.
</p>

<b>I have a question that is not listed here!</b>
<p>
  Feel free to <a href="mailto:pixels@quaran.to">email me</a> and I'll do my best.
