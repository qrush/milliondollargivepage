<h2>Give for Pixels</h2>

<hr class="c">


Yes, this is a parody site, with a real purpose: Instead of buying pixels, you donate to any charity/non-profit, then email proof and your pixels. Lucky for you, we have a million pixels to give!<p>

Pixels on The Million Dollar Givepage are available in 100 pixel 'blocks', with each block measuring 10x10 pixels. You will see the givepage is divided into 10,000 of these blocks. The reason for splitting them up in these blocks is because anything smaller than 10x10 pixels would be too small to display anything meaningful.
</p><p> (However, if you want to own less than 100 pixels - eg. one pixel - you could
  always club together with family/friends/colleagues and donate together to get a single 10x10 block.)<br>
  <br>
  <font color="red">Example Pixel Sizes:<br>
  <a href="10x10.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="100_ex.jpg" width="170" height="75" border="0"></a><a href="50x10.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="500_ex.jpg" width="170" height="75" border="0"></a><a href="100x50.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="5000_ex.jpg" width="170" height="75" border="0"></a></font>
</p><p>



Each 10x10 block requires a donation of US$100, equating to a cost of $1 per pixel. If you did not do the donation in USD, we'll round down to the closest amount based on current exchange rates. You can donate for as many blocks of pixels as you like, as long as there are some available (see the live stats in the top right corner of the page). Please read all of the following T's &amp; C's if you are about to donate for some pixels - especially those marked in red.</p><p>



</p><h4 class="gold">Terms and Conditions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The minimum donation is $100 (100 pixels), and the maximum donation is whatever
    is left
  </li><li>Links and image cannot be changed once published for any reason
  </li><li><font color="red">No obscene/offensive/adult images/links will be accepted, and I decide what
    is appropriate for my site. If you submit an image or link that is rejected,
    you will have the opportunity to provide an alternative, otherwise your money
    will be refunded and you will lose your pixels
  </font></li><li>Images must be the exact size you have donated for (eg. 100 pixels = 10x10
    pixels)
  </li><li>Images must be in GIF or JPEG format, and a reasonable file size <font color="red">
  </font></li><li><font color="red">Images must NOT be animated (imagine how messy the givepage would look)</font>
  </li><li>Links must be to web pages only and begin with http:// or https://
  </li><li>You must have the authority to provide the image and link for the website you submit
</li></ul>
<p>



Ok great, so now you're all set to donate to get some pixels. Go forth and donate to any charity or non-profit!</p><p>



</p><h4 class="gold">I've donated, now what?</h4>



Because the pixels are given in $100 blocks, please ensure you order the correct quantity of blocks when ordering. Once you have donated for your pixels, please e-mail <a href="mailto:pixels@quaran.to">pixels@quaran.to</a> with the following:<br>

<font color="#000099">

<ol><li>Attach your image as a GIF or JPEG (must be correct size for the pixels donated), along with some kind of proof that you donated to a charity or non-profit organization<p>

</p></li><li>State where you want your graphic to be placed on the givepage (eg. "50 blocks across, 20 blocks down"). Make sure you are certain, because you can't change it later.<p>

</p></li><li>State which website you would like your graphic linking to (must begin with 'http://')<p>

</p></li><li>State what TITLE/ALT text you want for your image, max. 50 characters. TITLE/ALT text appears when people hover their cursor over your image. An idea for what to say: Where you donated to!</li></ol><p>



<!--
<b>Current estimated time from ordering your pixels to going live on givepage: <font color="#cc0000">24 hours</font> (please allow up to 48hrs).
